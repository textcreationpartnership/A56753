            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>WE can never sufficiently adore the goodness of God, in making the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of our everlasting undistur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Rest, so effectual for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33060:5"/> Comfort. While we serve, we please him; we ease and gratifie our own Minds; are made partakers of the Divine Nature, by imitating the Divine Perfections, in Goodness, Righteousness and Truth, and so become acceptable to him, and our selves too. Notwithstanding the rude Treatment <hi>Religion</hi> finds from an ungrateful World, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on Earth so conducive to our Satisfaction and Delight in it, as <hi>making that our Business:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>to procure and preserve the Peace and Joy of our Souls,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first Place; let us <hi>discard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very evil Thing,</hi> and so <hi>keep our selves in the Love of God</hi>

No spiteful rancour to corrode his Heart. No boisterous passions to ruffle his Mind. No inordinate Appetites, perverse Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, corrupt Designs, to distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per his Soul, or disturb his Life.</p>
               <p>What is there belonging to a Christian whence grief naturally can Spring? From God, our exceeding Joy; the fountain of Happiness and all comfort? From Heaven, the region of Light and Bliss? From his Law, which inlightens, chears, rejoyces the Heart, is sweeter than the Honey, or Honey Comb? From
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33060:40"/> Wisdom, whose ways are pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and all her paths Peace? From the contemplation of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Truth? From the sense of his Favour? From the pardon of our Sins? From the influences, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Divine Grace? From the hopes, and anticipation of everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bliss. From virtue, which cures our afflictive Distempers, composes our vexatious Passions? From those sweet Sources, about which a Christian, as such, is only conversant, no Sorrow can be deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no bitter stream Flow. But Hell, the Flesh, the World, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Error, Folly, Sin, Irreligion, (things with which a Christian hath nothing to do; from which he keeps aloof; which he utterly Renounces and Abandons) they only are the Parents of discomfort and anguish.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, there's the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Obligation, Possibility, that we should rejoyce always, as that we
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33060:41"/> should always be Christians; exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performing Duty, totally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing Sin. For, innocence, and indolence; perfect Virtue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Alacrity, ever go together, are inseperable Companions, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Happiness.</p>
